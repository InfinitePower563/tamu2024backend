<h1><i>Emergency Funds</i></h1>
<h2>What is an emergency fund?</h2>
<p>An emergency fund is a separate account that you keep that you dip into in case of an emergency. For example, if you
    get injured when you have no money, then you can dip into your emergency fund to help you pay for the healthcare
    costs.</p>
<h2>How much money should I be putting in my emergency fund?</h2>
<p>According to <a
        href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/emergency-fund/whats-the-right-emergency-fund-amount">Vanguard</a>,
    an emergency fund should last at least 3-6 months of living expenses. You realistically don’t need to put that much
    money into your emergency fund. A good rule of thumb is to take your disposable income (amount of money left after
    taxes and cost of living expenses), and put 30% of it into your emergency fund and 30% into your savings. If you
    also invest your emergency fund into high yield savings, then you can also earn a little extra money on the fund as
    well.
</p>
<h2>What should I use my emergency fund for?</h2>
<p>Please note that these lists are not exhaustive. Use your own judgement for determining whether a situation warrants
    the use of your emergency fund.</p>
