<h1><i>Investing</i></h1>
<h2>What is investing (in simple terms)?</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that I am starting a company. I will ask you, an investor, to give me money to start my business.
    Later, when my business starts making money, then you will receive a percentage of the profits that I make.
    Alternatively, other people can see the value of my company, and pay you money to buy your percentage of my company.
    By selling your percent of my company (called a “share”), you can earn profit in the difference between the money
    that you spend on my company and the price you sell to someone else.</p>
<h2>How do I start investing?</h2>
<p>Investing is very simple. You can start by investing in “stocks,” which are shares of pre-existing companies. Some
    stocks offer “dividends,” which pay you a percentage of the company over time. You can go to <a
            href="https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal">Vanguard (not
        sponsored)</a>, create an account, and start buying shares. You should purchase “index funds” like VOO. Index
    funds are
    collections of multiple companies’ stock, so that the prices are less likely to go down. Don’t let the high price of
    VOO deter you; you can buy fractions of a stock, called “fractional shares.” When you decide that you want to sell
    your shares, then you can simply sell them through the portal. Remember: buy low, sell high. Remember the price that
    you buy the shares and try to sell them for an amount higher than what you bought it for. Also, remember to consider
    capital gains tax when determining whether it’s worth it to sell a stock.</p>
